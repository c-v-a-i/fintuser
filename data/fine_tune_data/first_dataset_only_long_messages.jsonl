The message format is quite \"direct,\" but I didn't mean to offend or touch a nerve.\n\nStarting with the main point, the primary goal for a beginner is to get an interview at all costs. Therefore, you need to remove anything that might \"scare\" HR away.\n\n- Remove your birth date (if needed, they will ask). In frontend development (on average): \u2026-22 for juniors, 22-25 for mid-levels, 26-\u2026 for seniors, etc. (that\u2019s how it is in Ukraine). Essentially, you should be a senior, so it's better to hide this and quickly grow to the necessary level.\n\n- The description needs to change: the company isn\u2019t interested in an employee's growth; they just need money. Juniors are usually hired for tasks that nobody wants to do or if the company has a low budget (mostly the case in our regions). Imagine you have your own startup, you've received investments, and you need people: seniors for core tasks, mid-levels for those seniors, and maybe a couple of juniors for mundane jobs. What kind of junior would you hire? Look at your resume and answer: would you hire yourself? Your goal is to make it so that you confidently answer \"yes.\" Business is not charity, so they look at you like this: can you bring in money or not (after a while since you are a junior)? Companies don't care what you want. Unfortunately, that's how it is. You are a product, and you need to persuade them to buy you.)\n\n- From your work experience, remove the lines about self-education. It\u2019s better to simply state freelancing (even though that\u2019s already a clich\u00e9, so better to avoid that too). Write that you supported their website at the university, etc. Nowadays, there are plenty of jobs where you can work just for food (as a volunteer). Or find any professional developer who is working on a personal project and ask if you can help with it. You could find a struggling web studio in your city that does all sorts of PHP, Joomla, WordPress, etc. (I did that in my time).\n\n- Remove all references to Figma, Zeplin, VS Code, etc.\n\n- Remove references to Context API and hooks. That\u2019s part of React, which you already added.\n\nP.S. the first job is the hardest to get, and most beginners give up at this point. You just need to endure it. After that, things will be fine.)"}]}

Of course, these things can be tailored to a specific role, but for beginners, you're looking for either minimal experience with the stack used, or that they want it and are self-learning.\n\nSQL language? Probably for queries, but listed after commas with others, it seems strange. Of course, recruiters are looking for SQL from you, and even if you don't fully understand the efficiency of operations and scaling, it just wants to be mentioned. Similarly, the tools for developers. If you don't want details, I'd only keep Docker and that as an environment or packaging. In your categories, there are so few words that I would either condense them or provide more detail. There\u2019s a whole specialty for linters, it\u2019s not about learning MD to write.\nThere\u2019s nothing said about Go going forward. Who needs it besides Google, I'm not sure.

That is, in this line, there\u2019s simply no useful info for anyone.\nRegarding ML, there are heaps of libraries, and if I'm not mistaken, you should have a high-level understanding of why one library over another, and how to prepare and validate data.

For example, Java, Kotlin, Coroutines Flow, RxJava (the order is slightly off right now).\n- The grouping in Skills bothers me. Java, RxJava, Kotlin, KMM do not specifically relate to Android. I would move them to Programming Languages, especially considering KMM can be used for shared logic between Android and iOS. A separate testing point is a great experience)\n- Tools can also be dropped because, with your experience, it's unlikely they'll check if you used Git.\n- It\u2019s better to reduce the amount of information while increasing the font size. I faced this on my resume - it became many times more readable when I raised it from 10pt to 11pt, while reducing the amount of information and removing the unnecessary.\n- The methodologies you\u2019ve worked with can be omitted right away. In a programmer\u2019s resume, this looks unnecessary.\n- The experience at Gamma Technologies isn't clear when you say \"worked with three messengers\": did you develop three messengers? Did you communicate in three messengers? Did you work with the teams of these messengers to write your own?"}]}

Moreover, A2 is insufficient for communication in an English-speaking team. It's fine for reading documentation.\nQuestions and suggestions:\n1. 04.2022 - 06.2022 - how did you go into the future?\n2. In Postman, did you use the mock server? If yes, you can add that.\n3. SQL - it's unnecessary to list a set of keywords. You can simply say \"SQL - at the level of basic queries.\" Also, list the DBMS you've worked with - MS SQL, Postgres, etc.\n4. For Android - \"collecting\" - does that mean you don't write code, but assemble someone else's?\n5. It would be good to provide a list of the technologies/stack used.

There are no quantitative points like: added changes that speeded up the load by 30%. Improved code that increased the number of processed requests by 25% etc. If something like that can be added it would be great. If not, I recommend tracking these moments and adding them to the CV at least as draft text in the future. There are few soft skills. If possible, it would be good to add them somehow. For example: learned a new programming language or methodology or something else in N days and applied it at work (learnability). Held meetings and directly communicated with the client (communicability) etc.\n1) \"Have experience working independently and in teams of up to 30 people including mentoring and onboarding.\" -> \"Have experience working independently and in teams of up to 30 people.

When you send a resume, \"Willing to join\" is implied. \"Make the world better\" sounds like a buzzword that is not particularly liked. It can be replaced with something more useful like \"looking for an opportunity to join a challenging and interesting project ...\"\n3) \"Developing back-end services for Kaspi Contact Center and CRM system\" - It would be good to write down in the subpoints what exactly you personally did.\n4) \"Implementing code style and commit convention\" - I would rewrite as \"Improved code quality standards by implementing code style (ADD WHAT YOU USED FOR THIS) and commit convention.\"\n5) \"Improved CI/CD pipelines\" - if possible add how exactly."}]}

Therefore, sell yourself as an underrated junior with great potential. To do this, you should highlight the complexity of the tasks you solved (for example, the cost/power of power plants you modeled, the number of people under your supervision, well-known brands of companies you collaborated with). Then it will be visible that you were put into projects with a high cost of error - and you came out as a winner. Then there is a chance they will be willing to hire you \"for growth.\""}]}

If you want to go to Canada, there are two obvious options: remote work or an employer with LMIA.\n\n- Indicating a desired job title like \"Software Developer (NOC 21232)\" is good for applying to positions where there is a chance of getting a job offer for immigration programs. This resume will be strengthened by official language exam results (English/French) such as IELTS.\n- To understand the likelihood of immigration through a company, look for LinkedIn employees from CIS countries.\n- Use \"Software Engineer\" if the position is titled that way in the job listing. An engineer has fundamental training and can solve a broader range of tasks than just a developer.\n\n- Don't label the section; just list contacts.\n- Hide GitHub, as it has an unprofessional profile picture and outdated code from three years ago.\n\n- Middle Software Developer. The grade will be determined in the interview. By North American standards, you are a junior. However, it\u2019s better to just write \"Software Developer\" for immigration job applications and \"Software Engineer\" for the wider job market and remote work.\n- Selling yourself should start with the company where you work. Write selling text focusing on the scale of engineering tasks, distribution, and the number of clients, or just state that it's the top bank in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u21b3 What is the number of external and internal users impacted by these microservices? \n\u21b3 What technical metrics can underline your engineering expertise? Latency? Zero-bug tolerance? Throughput? Concurrent users? \n\u21b3 Show technical managers metrics and practices used in system design while describing your achievements.\n\u21b3 What caused the revenue growth? Did you build microservices from scratch that scale horizontally for what purpose?\n\u21b3 Why both programming languages, Java and Kotlin? Surely, there\u2019s something to be proud of without violating NDA.\n\u21b3 What were the timelines for the work done?\n\u21b3 What business processes or operational processes were positively impacted and how? \n\n\n\u21b3 java \u2192 Java\n\u21b3 core - you need to elaborate on the scope. Load/data volume/powerful engineering metrics = level of responsibility. Thus, metrics and delta of change should be provided.\n\u21b3 If you accelerated development after eliminating legacy bad code, then where did the deployment acceleration come from? You need to elaborate on what the basis was. It could also be a corporate cloud, which would further enhance your resume.\n\n\n\u21b3 This hints at your work as a manager. If you want to land a job with a managerial slant, provide more figures on how much money was saved, earned, or not lost.\n\u21b3 There is absolutely no scale or complexity. If you had written that you saved over $10M by developing and implementing integration automated tests for payment processing and\u2026 then elaborated on how that was achieved.\n\n\u21b3 Just rename the section\n\u21b3 Add THE DETAILS in projects that will be your competitive advantage over other candidates.\n\u21b3 Show scale through the number of downloads, verified documents, users.

If you're creating the back-end developer resume, your experience as an instructor is relevant, but it should only be mentioned in the Summary or Cover Letter. If you decide to create a separate resume for the instructor role, of course, you need to elaborate on your experience in detail (and highlight your developer experience).\n\n2) The SKILLS section is an important section for a technical person; it should be located at the top under the Summary. For readability, it\u2019s better to split it into Languages and Frameworks or something similar, but avoid overwhelming the reader with an alphabetical jumble.

This section would be useful if you spoke German or Spanish, for Europe it would be beneficial.\n* The Summary section overall contributes little; I would remove lengthy phrases to make it more straightforward. For example, instead of \"I have experience,\" say, \"Experience in multiple application domains, including construction management, education, and ERP system integration.\" Passionate about building engaging web interfaces. Used my backend development background to contribute to multiple full-stack initiatives. Ideally, this would include examples from your experience and metrics, for instance, your colleagues had an average bug-fixing time of 1 week because they had to coordinate between frontend and backend, but yours was 2 days because you understand both sides.\n* From the job descriptions, I would remove responsibilities and keep only achievements. From responsibilities, I would take the best-sounding points (like \"led projects\") and place them separately after the position title. In achievements, it's desirable to add metrics. For example, in your current job, the second bullet point, \"improved site performance,\" should specify by how much. In the next job, \"brought projects from conception to MVP,\" could include some details? Budget, how long the project took, what happened to this MVP\u2014was additional funding allocated for it, how many users it had, etc."}]}

Summary:\n- Why 'product and startup experience'? It usually makes sense to show Startup and Enterprise as two diametrically opposed sets.\n- Domain expertise should come straight in the first sentence. Please move 'fintech, robotics, IoT, web, SAAS, telecom, and IT-outsourcing' to the start. According to marketing principles, start with the advantages.\n- 2-3 key measurable achievements in the Summary. Need to grab attention with metrics, not adjectives.\n\n2. Experience\n- Each job is described, but WITHOUT scale amplifiers: revenue, number of people, market share, rankings, number of offices, transaction volume.\n- What does 'team productivity by a third' mean? What exactly is measured in productivity? Concrete process metrics before and after are needed. If they weren't measured, then build a hypothesis and find a way to prove that hypothesis in the interview. But you will have to quantify your impact. In addition to metrics, it will help to understand the number of teams and people so that the recruiter understands the scale of your influence.\n- The theme 'transparent and efficient workflow' is NOT revealed. To reduce assumptions and conjecture, show HOW exactly your work, tools, and processes allowed a 35% reduction in defects (where, by the way?). If you implemented monitoring, code analysis, automated tests by changing the development team's attitude towards the product - great. But show how the people you influenced the mindset of started to act DIFFERENTLY. Earlier they hammered nails with a microscope, now they do it with a hammer.\n\n- Everywhere start your achievements NOT WITH THE PROCESS, but with THE RESULT. And describe the processes with an answer to the question: how exactly was this result achieved?\n- Launched a rhythmic Release Train - 100500 ways to do this knowing the theory. But you found the recipe and it worked. IN PRACTICE. And there's no point in writing that you used the theory. Show what you did in practice, so it's clear that the framework underlies your effective actions.\n\n- Enumerating products (arm Pulse and servo-motors rDrive) makes sense only if you are responding to positions in the same business field and competitors/colleagues will happily buy your expertise. It's better to operate with product metrics without naming the products themselves if they aren't well-known to the general public. After all, for me as a recruiter, it's important that you reduced time to market through certain changes within certain deadlines and helped (directly or indirectly) the products achieve such MAU, DAU, ROI, Market Share, Retention, Churn, NPS, CSAT, Store Rank."}]}

an architect, product owner, or DevOps.\n\nAre 2 days a lot or a little? Maybe in the context of the business, it may even mean nothing if you don't provide relative figures\n\nWhat if the plan was made but then thrown out? I've seen how plans change as quickly as gloves when the market shifted. Here you need to indicate the impact on the business from another side, or in another way\n\nAgain, system security in a vacuum - that's a waste of money. For instance, if the company isn't interesting to anyone, then it can afford to neglect critical issues for 2-3 months or just cover the costs post-hack instead of addressing them preemptively. I believe companies in the US understand this well, so I recommend presenting that point differently\n\nFor now, that's all from me - I'll continue with my affairs."}]}

Is retention in the feature considered impact? I can't write anything else since the rest is impossible to measure in this case."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "* If you plan to add a summary, you could write there, \"ML Engineer with experience in LLMs...

On one hand, not everyone will read that far if there's no bullet point above. On the other hand, it will be a pleasant surprise for those who read to the end, and the resume will end on a strong note (and right now, it ends on the fact that you know Bash).\n\nYou can also strengthen the publications. If you know the acceptance rate of the conference and it is good (below 33%), you can indicate that; if it was an oral presentation, you can also mention that. Currently, the articles don't have citations, but if they appear later, you can indicate how many citations there are and add a link to Google Scholar.\n\nSeparately, you need to decide why you want to include publications and why you titled the section \"Research Projects.\" If you want to work as a researcher, then the resume needs to be completely rewritten. If you want to work as an engineer, then I wouldn't emphasize this too much. There may be doubts about whether you really want to be an engineer and whether you understand the difference between a Ph.D. and a commercial firm. But I'm in the USA, maybe the attitude is different in Germany."}]}

You studied manual QA in 2022, and we discussed that it's not a super in-demand profession at the moment. Plus, the QA field has suffered due to the ease of entering IT through it, and not only is the market now not great, but it's also flooded with testers of all kinds. In 2023-2024, companies went through layoffs, and many qualified specialists entered the market, including automation testers with substantial experience. Therefore, manual testers with two years of experience are not in high demand. Look for job openings in gambling; they need manual testers. As a thought for the future, some European and American banks need not automation testers, but also conditional manual testers."}]}
