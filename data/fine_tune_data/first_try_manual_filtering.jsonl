The advice would be more about gaining that relevant experience, I don\u2019t know how. Maybe through freelancing, or courses with job placement, as your current experience is not substantial.\nIn my opinion, it's better to remove those 'basic' labels.\nAlso, you mention technology as an interest \u2014 perhaps you have some applied projects (like Raspberry Pi or Arduino) that would make your education shine in conjunction with software engineering.\nHello! The message format is quite \"direct,\" but I didn't mean to offend or touch a nerve.\n\nStarting with the main point, the primary goal for a beginner is to get an interview at all costs. Therefore, you need to remove anything that might \"scare\" HR away.\n\n- Remove your birth date (if needed, they will ask). In frontend development (on average): \u2026-22 for juniors, 22-25 for mid-levels, 26-\u2026 for seniors, etc. (that\u2019s how it is in Ukraine). Essentially, you should be a senior, so it's better to hide this and quickly grow to the necessary level.\n\n- The description needs to change: the company isn\u2019t interested in an employee's growth; they just need money. Juniors are usually hired for tasks that nobody wants to do or if the company has a low budget (mostly the case in our regions). Imagine you have your own startup, you've received investments, and you need people: seniors for core tasks, mid-levels for those seniors, and maybe a couple of juniors for mundane jobs. What kind of junior would you hire? Look at your resume and answer: would you hire yourself? Your goal is to make it so that you confidently answer \"yes.\" Business is not charity, so they look at you like this: can you bring in money or not (after a while since you are a junior)? Companies don't care what you want. Unfortunately, that's how it is. You are a product, and you need to persuade them to buy you.)\n\n- From your work experience, remove the lines about self-education. It\u2019s better to simply state freelancing (even though that\u2019s already a clich\u00e9, so better to avoid that too). Write that you supported their website at the university, etc. Nowadays, there are plenty of jobs where you can work just for food (as a volunteer). Or find any professional developer who is working on a personal project and ask if you can help with it. You could find a struggling web studio in your city that does all sorts of PHP, Joomla, WordPress, etc. (I did that in my time).\n\n- Remove all references to Figma, Zeplin, VS Code, etc.\n\n- Remove references to Context API and hooks. That\u2019s part of React, which you already added.\n\nP.S. the first job is the hardest to get, and most beginners give up at this point. You just need to endure it. After that, things will be fine.)"}]}

Probably for queries, but listed after commas with others, it seems strange. Of course, recruiters are looking for SQL from you, and even if you don't fully understand the efficiency of operations and scaling, it just wants to be mentioned. Similarly, the tools for developers. If you don't want details, I'd only keep Docker and that as an environment or packaging.

That is, in this line, there\u2019s simply no useful info for anyone.\nRegarding ML, there are heaps of libraries, and if I'm not mistaken, you should have a high-level understanding of why one library over another, and how to prepare and validate data. If you're not afraid of questions - specify.\n\nOrganization names might not be well-known to foreigners, but when you have to search for them in the text, that's not good.\n\nHuawei suffers from formatting.

And personally, I prefer not to indicate hobbies, it's better to replace them with something useful.\nI think that for an entry-level position, you can briefly describe projects from GitHub directly in the resume, at least functionality and used technologies.\n+ \n\nAlso, I am very conservative regarding CV design and I think there should be more content than pictures. But maybe that's subjective.\nA person measures it in exactly the same way as everyone else. Apple sends a questionnaire before an interview, where self-evaluation is needed. Well numerically, not with stripes. Why are you all picking on them?\n\nRegarding education, it may be a valid point, but what difference does it make if they are still a lawyer, non-profile?\nTell me what's really important, let's leave nitpicking aside.\nI always imagine that a skill bar at 100% for JS means you know the language at the level of an architect and creator of the language itself) so even 70% - that's already a lot!\nNo, no, it's fine here.\nLet's get to the point\n\nI'm an enthusiastic Frontend Developer seeking an\nentry-level position at a company where I can use my\nprevious experience and skills in projects which push\nme to develop in the software engineering field and\nrelated spheres.\n\nBlah blah blah. What kind of person is this? What experience do they have? How can they be useful? 5 lines of nothing. A copy-paste from the first page of a Google search \"what to write at the beginning of a resume\"\nNo questions about language proficiency.\n\nNext, experience. Good experience! social responsibility - homeless people, kids, sports. All good.\n\nMy main responsibilities were\nto develop new user-facing features, build stable\ncode, collaborate with back-end developers and web\ndesigners to improve usability, write functional\nrequirement documents and guides, contribute to\ndaily scrum meetings, sprint reviews, and planning\nsessions.\n\nThis isn't CIA torture, one could probably reveal what those user features were, what they collaborated on with the back-end, what the person contributed to during meetings and sprint reviews. There\u2019s so much space - just describe it, don't hold back. Add links to projects. Point and say - I thought this up and embodied it.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s clear that this person was hired right after the internship - that's good. They must have performed better than others - why not mention that? Again, there\u2019s plenty of space, just remove the pizza.\nThis is just my opinion regarding the skill bars. They are useless and harmful. Because a person can't evaluate themselves normally, and to me, that doesn't look good.\n\nBetter to add numbers. This has been said many times, and people started adding, but the bars are still being shoved in.\n100% in JavaScript means Brendan Eich himself :).\nWell written, I generally agree.\nIn fact, I imagine a recruiter sitting there comparing. This candidate has 60%, and the other has 70%. Well, we're definitely taking the second one.\nThat's the point.\nOnce a recruiter asked to rate my Python skills on a 10-point scale without any criteria or scores given. I assumed 10 meant the level of Van Rossum and replied around 5. To which I heard: well, can it at least be a 6? The requirements state a minimum of 6/10.\n- Steve Jobs\nI need to respond, \"Yes, it's me. Hello.\"\nEven 50 percent is not bad, because 2 such people like you in a team is already Van Rossum!"}]}

For example, Java, Kotlin, Coroutines Flow, RxJava (the order is slightly off right now).\n- The grouping in Skills bothers me. Java, RxJava, Kotlin, KMM do not specifically relate to Android. I would move them to Programming Languages, especially considering KMM can be used for shared logic between Android and iOS. A separate testing point is a great experience)\n- Tools can also be dropped because, with your experience, it's unlikely they'll check if you used Git.\n- It\u2019s better to reduce the amount of information while increasing the font size. I faced this on my resume - it became many times more readable when I raised it from 10pt to 11pt, while reducing the amount of information and removing the unnecessary.\n- The methodologies you\u2019ve worked with can be omitted right away. In a programmer\u2019s resume, this looks unnecessary.\n- The experience at Gamma Technologies isn't clear when you say \"worked with three messengers\": did you develop three messengers? Did you communicate in three messengers? Did you work with the teams of these messengers to write your own?\nTo be honest, the work experience is difficult to read. \nI think it would be better to use bold font and increase the size for the company names."}]}

Regarding tech specialists, I can't imagine it; it's like you might not be liked due to your name or age. But maybe if the courses are all you have, it could influence decisions, like indicating poor education, so they won't even look. Maybe it's different in the Western market. My experience is that local tech specialists don't really know about courses and which ones are bad, at least that's my impression based on myself; I don't know of any courses.\nThese courses produce so many bad candidates that I think it's impossible not to know about the bad reputation of such courses.\nRegarding not being liked due to age, that's pretty common; according to the latest survey from dou, the median age is around 27-29 years.\nImagine, I don't know of any courses, especially bad ones. That's the context in Ukraine. I'd value individual assessments more; you can end up in a bad company or attend bad courses; that doesn't determine whether the person is fit for the open position.\nYes, that's incorrect, but it happens. If you frequently attend interviews, you can even learn to notice when the interviewer is having a bad day))) And the result depends on that, too. So here, you can't predict.)"}]}

You need to check tenses and the overall structure of the sentences. For example, \"deployed applications (\u2026) and conducted training for 1000 employees\". In general, it\u2019s better to run it through a native speaker.\r\n- My personal opinion, but I would combine the different positions within the company and only leave the highest position, and combine the bullet points. This will free up space and allow you to add, for example, projects\r\n- It\u2019s better to align the skills left so that they don't cross the right boundary. Or present them differently altogether\r\n- Education should be at the top, preferably instead of the summary, although I get scolded for this here.\nThe DACH region loves resumes with photos.

In some projects, it's easy to write 100k, while in others even deploying 1k in production is a significant challenge. The same goes for features - without knowledge of specifics, it\u2019s hard to understand whether 10 or 1k is a lot. In general, productivity and significance are no longer evaluated in such metrics. My thought behind mentioning such achievements was only to point out that there is real experience in analysis, design, and implementation of new APIs in projects with high demands for contributions, where such tasks are fundamentally more complex compared to simple bug fixes, refactorings, and other improvements in product software.

There are no quantitative points like: added changes that speeded up the load by 30%.

If not, I recommend tracking these moments and adding them to the CV at least as draft text in the future. There are few soft skills. If possible, it would be good to add them somehow. For example: learned a new programming language or methodology or something else in N days and applied it at work (learnability). Held meetings and directly communicated with the client (communicability) etc.\n1) \"Have experience working independently and in teams of up to 30 people including mentoring and onboarding.\" -> \"Have experience working independently and in teams of up to 30 people.

When you send a resume, \"Willing to join\" is implied. \"Make the world better\" sounds like a buzzword that is not particularly liked. It can be replaced with something more useful like \"looking for an opportunity to join a challenging and interesting project ...\"\n3) \"Developing back-end services for Kaspi Contact Center and CRM system\" - It would be good to write down in the subpoints what exactly you personally did.\n4) \"Implementing code style and commit convention\" - I would rewrite as \"Improved code quality standards by implementing code style (ADD WHAT YOU USED FOR THIS) and commit convention.\"\n5) \"Improved CI/CD pipelines\" - if possible add how exactly."}]}

For example, in your last job, instead of \"working ...\" + \"saved ...\" - it's usually not advisable to say what you did, but rather what you accomplished (keeping in mind Western project orientation). You can mention that you completed projects and their results.\n- Remove the photo; that's been a bad sign almost everywhere - no one wants to be \"discriminated\" against because of it.\n- Typo? - if you can, write it in a couple of words.\n- The second part of the sentence is unnecessary. Either remove it or just keep that you were promoted and why (very briefly).\n- A bit too much here; you can detect risks and dependencies, but you don't define optimisations and improvements; you solve issues based on what you detected. The sentence sounds too complex, in my opinion; don't expect that a recruiter or even a project manager will understand! :) Try to write a bit simpler.\n- My personal preference is to place the tech stack between experience and \"about me,\" but not at the end; it takes too long to get to it.

How much faster did it become?\n- Visually: the name, specialty, summary have shifted, they should be better aligned to the left, like everything else.\n- Extraneous: you can skip languages if they are not particularly necessary.

All these functionalities are currently in production and are used in workstations of support line staff for physical clients of the bank (over 100 million).\n      - Gathered and documented requirements for high-load notification integrations (JSONs via Kafka with 100 peak tps) with the bank's communication channels to register clients' requests. These integrations allowed to transfer at least 50% of the transactional load from the legacy CRM System to a new solution.\n      - Reached an agreement with analytics of multiple teams on attributes of a business event.

It depends on where and for how long you are sending it, right now there is still a post-holiday swamp. I think we can raise LinkedIn and GitHub to contacts, and completely remove Facebook, thus the extra section will collapse. \n\nAlso, I think that after summary and skills, the most valuable is experience, so maybe it should be placed in that order. Education might confuse recruiters; I would mark it more obviously that it is online (if the goal is the foreign market). \n\nI sent a connection request on LinkedIn \ud83d\ude42\nTo detail work experience, including some metrics and stack. Maybe add projects if you are doing them in MA. Remove the description of the MA program, better outline relevant coursework.\nYes, there are very few signals here; the education situation is completely unclear. I wouldn\u2019t miss this CV. It seems there is information for beginners pinned, but I would restructure your resume. \n- Make a summary of 1-2 sentences, from which it should be clear what you already know and which field you want to move into: there\u2019s data science (which is closer to ML), there are systems analysts who write business requirements, there are data engineers... I don\u2019t understand who you are. You have a master\u2019s in data science, but it\u2019s unclear whether you write SQL queries or if you are interested in something more?????? \n- You can actually remove the profiles altogether, add LinkedIn and GitHub to the contact section. \n- Redo the skills section, move soft skills to the end and shorten them, detail the technical ones. What library have you used in Python, what machine learning techniques can you apply, what is data management? What is data modeling? \n- Education: bachelor for 4 years + master for 2, add other training courses in a separate section. \n- Separate section with courses: online program, PMI Coursera, all of that. \n- And by the way, work experience is actually fine.

We used to use hard-coded links, but now we configure it on the fly in our parametric model.\"\nYou should answer that this format is not the best-selling one and should rather be converted to the following style:\n\"Implemented a dynamic subscription model using Stripe API, replacing hard-coded links with a parametric configuration, resulting in a more scalable and flexible payment system.\"\n```\nYour task is to criticise the CV and suggest the improvements.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "document:\n  knowledge:\n  -

We used to use hard-coded links, but now we configure it on the fly in our parametric model.\"\nYou should answer that this format is not the best-selling one and should rather be converted to the following style:\n\"Implemented a dynamic subscription model using Stripe API, replacing hard-coded links with a parametric configuration, resulting in a more scalable and flexible payment system.\"\n```\nYour task is to criticise the CV and suggest the improvements.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "document:\n  sections:\n  -

Everyone is interested in the tasks a person dealt with. There should be specific points about what you did. Too much space is taken up by some technologies. The number of them is unimportant; it's better to write down about five basics rather than listing every library that HR knows nothing about. Evaluating skills by these circles is just a waste. What does 1 out of 5 mean? That you are bad at algorithms and should not be hired? Profiles - the description of what leetcode is is of no interest to anyone; you can keep the profile if you want. The GitHub profile - I haven't looked; usually, it's recommended to format it nicely so that even non-programmers can visit and read some readme files about the projects and their essence. If there are no decent projects or readme files - the profile can be removed, especially since it is already mentioned at the top in contacts."}]}

Based on those metrics, you can indirectly judge: whether it's a finished polished project for demonstrating skills with an emphasis on performance and code quality, or it's just something from a course / copy-paste.\n\nIf I didn't have the brains to distinguish one from the other, then simply having working code that you can view on a demo site/stand already gave candidates an edge.\n\nA link to GitHub \u2192 Demonstration of skills to save time, or a way to grab the attention of the hiring manager, allowing you to steer the interview onto your terms and showcase your deep knowledge of the language/framework.\nIf such a GitHub allowed skipping one or two technical screenings, then it would be worth formatting it.

In a normal world, a mid-level seems to be around 1-3 years.\nA junior is basically a person without experience but with projects.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n1-3 and 1.5. What's wrong?\nAssociate or Junior often up to 3 years of experience. Over 3 years is already mid-level.\nNever less than 2 years has a mid-level even in the best of times.\nIt's fine, I was able to get a mid-level position with that experience.\nIn the Western market, a year and a half is indeed too little for a mid-level - especially in such a competitive field as CV (and all ML in general).\nA mid-level is probably around 5 years in tier 1-2 companies, on average. Moreover, a senior is already a terminal position. In tier 3 and below, titles may be inflated and often differ by +1-2 positions.\nThe question is probably more about what you did during this time, rather than how long you were sitting around.\n\n A candidate with 1.5 years of active contribution will be a better candidate than one who just passed 4 years. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\n\n If you actively contributed and showed higher-level qualities, then what's the problem?\nI have the same situation; I got a mid-level position with 1.5 years.\nBut this is a prepared team lead in Sberbank.\nMost likely you are right (I don't have that much experience yet to clearly delineate these time frames for positions in tier 1-2 companies), but I doubt that if a person has been a junior at Google for 5 years, they cannot claim a senior position at Yandex (they would take them 100 percent). It seems that by hard skills, a Junior can partly compare with a senior in terms of code (the question of its quality, of course, also arises), technologies, frameworks, but the main difference lies in the connection with the business and its understanding. A junior doesn't know about management, a senior does. If I'm wrong, please correct me.)\nAnd isn't principal and architect above senior?"}]}

Recruiters have a ton of tabs open, and if someone is easily recognizable on all their profiles, it means you've cared about the hiring side.\n\n- On GitHub, besides the link to LinkedIn and your photo, you should definitely describe your projects so that a non-programmer understands: what value your code has, what problem/issue you were solving, why, how it can potentially be used in business, and how it improves people's lives.\n- In essence, you can describe your repos using the STAR framework without showing a graveyard of code. This could help recruiters realize that you care about business and people, which means you're better than 99% of other candidates in equal circumstances. Few engineers are ready to think and demonstrate their business thinking.\n\nThe fact is, companies can choose candidates who will bring maximum ROI in a specific position.\nWell, you've answered your question :) Of course, after 3 years of work experience, projects are only shown by those who are drastically changing their career vector and want to shift from frontend to backend, for example, or from development to PM roles.\nYou should consider changing your email; in an English-speaking environment, it's at best unclear and, for Russian speakers, sounds unprofessionally loud. \n<name>.<surname>@example.com would be best.\nThank you very much for the response!\nI support you.\nInstead of some strange transliterate mastep70, a more appropriate name would be regular pussy.hunter70."}]}

But there are positions where they specifically indicate languages like German, Polish, etc. So thinking that besides English nothing interests anyone is a bit much.\nThere's barely a B2 there, at best maybe A1.5.)\nWho cares if a person knows Kazakh, Russian, Ukrainian and is applying in Europe?\n\nIf you\u2019re applying in Germany, indicating that you know German plus English might make sense.\nIf a company requires knowledge of languages from you, they'll ask you to list all the languages you know on the application. It's unnecessary on the resume and just takes up space.\nWrite it as it is. If they ask you questions and you can't follow along, it'll be awkward. \nYou could also link to a certificate or the language level certificate.\nGalleries in Europe often 'speak Russian'; then what? I know at least three major companies where I had interviews in Russian within teams that spoke Russian.\nBy the way, about languages in Europe.\nI also had an interview in Russian when applying to Germany. But it's not clear, what if your name is Ivan Ivanov?\n\nSo that's not an argument at all.\nWhen I responded, I noted that \"no one needs any language other than English.\" But the person clung to the Russian language.\nWhen applying for what? We're talking about IT here. I have reverse cases where HRs, not seeing the mention of Russian, \u2018drove me\u2019 to interviews, and then there was embarrassment. \u2018Oh, you speak Russian.\u2019 So yes, that\u2019s not an argument.\nAbsolutely, English is a must. How can you work in IT without it?\nIn all the resumes above, it lists Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh. I was implying that the presence of these languages (okay, almost) is of no interest to anyone unless you know the language of the country you're applying to (I cited the example with Germany), then it might make sense to mention it.\n\nI don't understand what you're stuck on.)\nThis point was 'voiced' deliberately. But on the other hand, when the team speaks in their native language, it enhances speed and simplifies communication.\nAbsolutely, I always list all my languages and realistic fluency levels.

Still, remove the languages (you can add them if needed by tailoring the resume to the job).\nSquad is more about the army than programming. You need to add more specifics about the application area, how many users, how much profit there was for the company, and what improvements you made regarding development, best practices, etc. You can look for analyses by Alexander Valuyev here in the chat. They highlight the logic of resume writing well, even if they aren't specifically about mobile apps.\nHardly anyone is interested in what languages you know other than English, and by stating your English level, you're just giving an unnecessary reason for doubt.\nMe: I know Python\nEveryone: No one cares, English is better\n:DDD\nP.S. Just a moment of humor.\nIn the USA, it matters. In many companies, it will be a plus.\nFor example, in which ones? Name a couple.\nIn most cases, in none unless you hit it off with fellow countrymen.\nIn Chase, they told me that languages are a plus. I'm not saying that it's really important, but as a small advantage.\nFor a programmer position? I highly doubt it. If it's as a consultant in an office in Brighton, then maybe.\nDiversity, though. Recruiters first look at the resumes, and with everything being equal, such a small plus can matter. If there's room to keep languages, it's worth it."}]}

I recommend creating a Summary section, as shown in the sample resume above.\n\nWhat you did at work should be framed in terms of outcomes.

If you decide to create a separate resume for the instructor role, of course, you need to elaborate on your experience in detail (and highlight your developer experience).\n\n2) The SKILLS section is an important section for a technical person; it should be located at the top under the Summary.

And here arises the question: do you want to be a back-end developer or do you want to be a Backend Development Instructor? Or are you open to any proposal? In that case, create two resumes. If you're creating the back-end developer resume, your experience as an instructor is relevant, but it should only be mentioned in the Summary or Cover Letter. If you decide to create a separate resume for the instructor role, of course, you need to elaborate on your experience in detail (and highlight your developer experience).\n\n2) The SKILLS section is an important section for a technical person; it should be located at the top under the Summary. For readability, it\u2019s better to split it into Languages and Frameworks or something similar, but avoid overwhelming the reader with an alphabetical jumble. Naturally, what you are strongest in should come to the forefront.\n\n3) The SUMMARY needs rewriting; there is a lot of fluff (\"Have experience with different types of architecture and technologies\" - this sentence tells nothing about you). It\u2019s important to understand which role you\u2019re aiming for.\nHello!\nSkills are great.\nExperience is good; for example, you can show it for mid-level positions.\nSasha Tomsky's comments are useful; I thought of adding something myself, but he already covered everything.\nAre you definitely leaving?)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you)\nI was already thinking of applying for senior positions as I feel ready.\nIn what context?)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For such positions, I can\u2019t say much; I\u2019m a mid-level myself)\n\nBut overall, for a senior, you have good work experience, showing that you communicate and solve real problems.

From responsibilities, I would take the best-sounding points (like \"led projects\") and place them separately after the position title. In achievements, it's desirable to add metrics.

Summary:\n- Why 'product and startup experience'? It usually makes sense to show Startup and Enterprise as two diametrically opposed sets.\n- Domain expertise should come straight in the first sentence. Please move 'fintech, robotics, IoT, web, SAAS, telecom, and IT-outsourcing' to the start. According to marketing principles, start with the advantages.\n- 2-3 key measurable achievements in the Summary. Need to grab attention with metrics, not adjectives.\n\n2. Experience\n- Each job is described, but WITHOUT scale amplifiers: revenue, number of people, market share, rankings, number of offices, transaction volume.\n- What does 'team productivity by a third' mean? What exactly is measured in productivity? Concrete process metrics before and after are needed. If they weren't measured, then build a hypothesis and find a way to prove that hypothesis in the interview. But you will have to quantify your impact. In addition to metrics, it will help to understand the number of teams and people so that the recruiter understands the scale of your influence.\n- The theme 'transparent and efficient workflow' is NOT revealed. To reduce assumptions and conjecture, show HOW exactly your work, tools, and processes allowed a 35% reduction in defects (where, by the way?). If you implemented monitoring, code analysis, automated tests by changing the development team's attitude towards the product - great. But show how the people you influenced the mindset of started to act DIFFERENTLY. Earlier they hammered nails with a microscope, now they do it with a hammer.\n\n- Everywhere start your achievements NOT WITH THE PROCESS, but with THE RESULT. And describe the processes with an answer to the question: how exactly was this result achieved?\n- Launched a rhythmic Release Train - 100500 ways to do this knowing the theory. But you found the recipe and it worked. IN PRACTICE. And there's no point in writing that you used the theory. Show what you did in practice, so it's clear that the framework underlies your effective actions.\n\n- Enumerating products (arm Pulse and servo-motors rDrive) makes sense only if you are responding to positions in the same business field and competitors/colleagues will happily buy your expertise. It's better to operate with product metrics without naming the products themselves if they aren't well-known to the general public. After all, for me as a recruiter, it's important that you reduced time to market through certain changes within certain deadlines and helped (directly or indirectly) the products achieve such MAU, DAU, ROI, Market Share, Retention, Churn, NPS, CSAT, Store Rank."}]}

But then I realized you're applying for a front-end role, which is a different world. There are many important things: not hanging the interface when data comes, design and layout, CSS/SCSS, and specific libraries like RxJS, Redux, etc. From the entire set in the CV, it looks more like full-stack - maybe go for that?\nThis might be nitpicking, but the whole text is really stretched sideways, my eyes are straining, and also my links aren't clickable\u2014maybe a bug, email/LinkedIn are clickable, but the projects are not."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where's the best place to add about working with databases and writing SQL statements?\nDon't full stack roles require different technologies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Full-stack allows you to handle both backend and frontend (MEAN, LEAN, etc.). I saw MongoDB there, Node, and Angular. You can have it. MongoDB, Node.js, Express (REST) for backend, React/Angular for frontend, and you can implement JWT for authorization (just don't forget to Google \"never use JWT\").\nThat's about it. SQL is very important; the main thing is to understand there is ANSI SQL, and then everything else like TSQL/PSQL/other SQL. This is important everywhere; you don't need to learn how to do simple queries: SELECT/JOIN/UPDATE/DELETE already cover 90% of requests for backend. Everything else develops as the project grows, like indexes, for example.\nCORS should probably be set at the server/proxy level, like with nginx or apache, not just in technologies; it's more something that needs configuring.\nWhile looking for a job, don't forget to read and once you get to MongoDB/Node/Express, start adding NestJS/Swagger/Auth2, or you might dive into MeteorJS and add pub/sub\u2014next thing you know, you'll find out that the MeteorJS team created Apollo.\nHi, briefly, why is it not recommended to use JWT?\nI didn't say it's a bad idea. I said you should Google 'never use JWT.' You just need to understand what freedom it gives and what obligations come with it. Many treat it as a panacea, but it's not always suitable.\nWhat do you recommend using instead? \ud83e\udd14 I recently used it in a project; it is handy, and it's hard to steal, but doing something with it is also a problem.\nYou don't need to replace it with anything; it's used in Firebase (Google) and Auth0. You need to read a lot and understand what's easy to steal and what's hard, and how to use them!\nJust like in a joke, \"Math analysis knows something; I'll just give it a 5 and let it go.\"\nPack the JWT in cookies, and make sure to set the appropriate flags and prefixes for the cookies."}]}

It would be much more HUMAN to write a few general words without specifics about what you want to convey. Like, I'm really a dude. Just an expert.\nWhy separate work projects into a separate list and force people to jump back and forth or hold all this info in their head? Why not consolidate all the info about one job/project in one place?\nA bit off-topic. Do they also widely use tea in Cyprus, that you mention it in your resume?"}]}

Here I shared an example of a magnificent resume for US graduates, which this resume will be impossible to compete with.\nThere is room in the resume, it would be great to elaborate on points like \"Developed two corporate portals for company employees\" in more detail. Corporate portals are not just 1-2 HTML pages, there are technically complex details, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something to find. For example, if you implemented an authorization/registration system, you can elaborate: \"Implemented an authorization system for a corporate portal using JWT authorization: employed gRPC and its interceptors for token validation and renewal via a JavaScript library XYZ\".\n\n\"Developed a component library\" - what kind of component was it, what does it do? There can be details here too.\n\nIn general, it would be good to specify specifics.\n\nAlso, in the section \"Developed a component library\" there is a mix. It would be good to break it into several parts, perhaps remove something (like GitLab/GitHub, replacing it with Git - the hosting platform is not important, the version control system is).\n\n\"Skilled in React\" - but the React versions are not indicated? As far as I remember, around version 18 there were some global changes/features.\n\nMongoDB, by the way, is not SQL, it is document-based.\n\nIn the education section, you can indicate a list of relevant courses (for example, distributed systems/algorithms & data structures or something).\nHere\u2019s another one."}]}

Ideally, you should add some business metric here, for example, that the hints provided by the system had a click-through rate of XX.

For example, \"achieving an accuracy of 0.97\". Depending on the dataset you are working with, 0.97 can be very difficult or very easy. Ideally, you should add some business metric here, for example, that the hints provided by the system had a click-through rate of XX. If you don't have these numbers, it would be better to at least compare with something, like in the bullet point for Stepik, where you at least compare with the previous version.\n* The publications are not very noticeable; if I hadn't read your message that \"projects are not sorted\", I would have missed them. I would either add a summary or a bullet point in the current work that \"there are two publications\". However, you already have many bullet points in your current job, so you should break them up somehow.\n* \"Successfully pitched and promoted this initiative to senior management\" is a useful skill, and it should be described in more detail. Like, Designed a new feature, pitched to the CEO, secured budget for X person-months, developed and deployed the feature, which increased user engagement by X.\n\u2022 Single-handedly developed multiple AI assistants using RAG to guide users through their learning paths. Conducted detailed analytical research to measure the impact of these AI assistants on user engagement.\n\nSingle-handedly developed implies that there are situations where 2 developers sit at the monitor and code.\n\nIf we bring this bullet point to normality, it would be:\n\nDeveloped AI assistants using RAG to increase user engagement during the learning process by 10%.\n\nIn other bullet points, the same wording error can be seen. The project and technology are detached from the business impact."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How's it better to show the publications? Should I highlight them in a separate section, for example, \"published articles\"?\nI didn't quite understand. Single-handedly translates as \"in solitude\" (GPT rewrote it for me). \"Without help from anyone else\" says Google Translate.\n\nIs the fact that the project is detached from the business impact due to the lack of some metrics showing the impact? Is retention in the feature considered impact? I can't write anything else since the rest is impossible to measure in this case."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If there are several, then yes, definitely. Publications are great especially if they are in the employer's language.\n* If you plan to add a summary, you could write there, \"ML Engineer with experience in LLMs... Developed and deployed novel models that improved X by Y%... Published two peer-reviewed papers.\"\n* If not, then add a bullet point in your work or education, \"Published two peer-reviewed papers.\"\n* At the very least, highlight them in bold.\n\nIf you add a section \"Publications,\" it will be at the very end. On one hand, not everyone will read that far if there's no bullet point above. On the other hand, it will be a pleasant surprise for those who read to the end, and the resume will end on a strong note (and right now, it ends on the fact that you know Bash).\n\nYou can also strengthen the publications. If you know the acceptance rate of the conference and it is good (below 33%), you can indicate that; if it was an oral presentation, you can also mention that. Currently, the articles don't have citations, but if they appear later, you can indicate how many citations there are and add a link to Google Scholar.\n\nSeparately, you need to decide why you want to include publications and why you titled the section \"Research Projects.\" If you want to work as a researcher, then the resume needs to be completely rewritten. If you want to work as an engineer, then I wouldn't emphasize this too much. There may be doubts about whether you really want to be an engineer and whether you understand the difference between a Ph.D. and a commercial firm. But I'm in the USA, maybe the attitude is different in Germany.\nI wouldn't emphasize 'in solitude.' It's better to rephrase it to something like 'delivered an end-to-end solution,' so the emphasis is not on one person but on knowing all aspects from start to finish. Otherwise, it raises questions like 'if the project didn't have enough resources, maybe it wasn't needed at all.'"}]}

You will understand what I mean when you try to answer the question how? We engineers don't care about the percentage of teachers who came back. Customer satisfaction takes care of that. I'm curious where all these events were sent, the volume of messages, was there geographical distribution? Basically, I want to understand if this is a makeshift project or a real stressed system, with thousands of users and 24/7 availability.\nBullet points are scrutinized, and you need to know how to give a detailed answer for each of them in interviews. But they're unlikely to be the reason for rejection from HR.\nWow, you're really an admin here.\nSeriously, how?) I honestly admitted that I improved something, while I just made up the numbers, and they hired me.)\nSo should I not write everything on one page?\nIt happens.\nWell, it depends on what you wrote.\nFor instance, I mentioned that I implemented CI/CD and increased team performance by X percent, while the number of bugs decreased by Y%.\nExplanation - simple.\nBefore I came, there was no CI/CD in the team, and they deployed into production without running unit and integration tests. I implemented CI/CD. Before rolling it out, I looked at the story velocity over the last conditional 3 months, the number of bugs, and the number of features taken in each sprint. Then I did the same after rolling out CI/CD; velocity increased, we could take more stories per sprint, the number of bugs decreased, calculated percentages, profit."}]}

I would remove all those Yandex and other .ru things as nobody knows them here, and as Artem noted earlier, it might scare off potential employers.\nThen, for Technical Skills - they don't overlap with the experience description, get rid of VirtualBox - it's only used in home labs, it doesn't sell you, Zabbix - almost nobody knows it here, it's more like Nagios/Nagios XI derivatives, add RHEL to CentOS - they're practically the same, create a free developer account on RH, try out subscription management, also, Ansible - did you use Tower or AWX? If yes, mention it.\nDid you work with hardware? Mention it, like out-of-band management - iLO, IPMI, iDRAC, etc.\nDid you deal with storage? SAN, NAS, iSCSI, FC - mention it, did you ever do backup/disaster recovery? Mention it, if you have experience with tape libraries, documentation, RPO/RTO, stakeholder communication, etc. - include everything.\nDid you set up high availability and fault tolerance? Great, write about your experience with clusters.\nDid you create users in ADUC? Good, note your IAM experience, did you sort them by groups? Oh, so you configured RBAC. Did you deploy updates? Patching and vulnerability management and remediation, NIST SP 800-40 ties in well with your diploma.\nHave you heard of ITIL? If not, familiarize yourself immediately, many old-fashioned firms prefer this.\n\"Led server and workstation virtualization efforts using MS Hyper-V hypervisors, optimizing resource utilization and scalability\" - and what did you do there? Were there any P2V migrations? Where is that written? Etc.\nIn general - when there's a lot of diverse, loosely related stuff, it positions you as a rookie; with such a resume, you will find work only in SMBs or MSPs - both are bad, a lot of work, little money, and poor treatment.\nFinally, a couple of things that significantly limit you - lack of experience with public cloud - Azure, AWS, GCP, and various tools like MS 365.\nAdditionally, for admin positions, it\u2019s advisable to obtain some certifications.\nAnd don't hesitate to throw out the PBXs, nobody really needs that."}]}

It seems like a translator. There are mistakes, for example, 3-4 May.\n3) It's better not to write that you developed project A, but instead write: in project A, I solved tasks B, C, D, and implemented this and that.\n4) Description for Goodoc: Development ... planning reception and chat using GPT-4. What?\nIntern/TL\n\nIt's like saying I want 200k rub, but if anything, 30k will do too.\nLinks aren't clickable. \nLots of typos. \nInconsistent fonts.\n\nIs it even worth mentioning the bootcamp if you're still studying at the university? Like, I often understand a bootcamp as a guy, a 40+ year old locksmith who found out from his neighbor that IT specialists make a lot of money and decided to get into it. \nProbably better to indicate reliable course work (IMHO).\nI don't think you should apply for a senior or mid-level+ position based on this resume. So, regarding leadership, you can completely remove it, and better to make it one column since you aren't a frontend/UX UI designer.\n\nAnd one more question regarding language, is it a local trend to write half in Russian and half in English?\nAs mentioned above, it's better to redo it using one of the templates that are pinned.\n\nDo you want to be an ordinary Java Developer or a team lead? If you're going for lead, then we skip intern and just keep lead.\n\nIf you're not going for lead, then there's no point in stating that you had lead responsibilities.\n\nIn general, mentioning that you were an intern is pointless, you can say that if you worked there for a short time, it's better to specify the concrete position.\n\nThe stack can be removed if it's described in the projects, that way you'll save space.\n\nAgain, the story \"we in the team, we... we...\" should be replaced with what exactly you did, the resume is supposed to tell about you ;)"}]}
