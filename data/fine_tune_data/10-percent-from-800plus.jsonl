All phrases need proofreading and should be brought closer to what is typically written in the USA. For instance, \"Digital transformation of the information system\" or \"continued development\" immediately makes it evident that the resume was written by someone not from the local market. 2. It’s crucial to analyze the job market to form a complete picture of what positions fit you and where you have a chance of finding a job (considering competition), as well as what terminology is used in companies where such positions are usually open. What roles they have, what projects, how they talk about them, etc. Based on this resume, it needs to be customized for each market segment. For example, there is a very large segment in America for ERP implementations. If this were Europe, I would say that you could go into Odoo development (it's an ERP in Python), and then all the experience would need to be rewritten with terms like \"ERP business analyst\" / \"ERP consultant\" / \"ERP technical project manager,\" etc. In the USA, unfortunately, I can't recall any popular Python-based ERPs. But the essence is the same everywhere. Python is also vast. It needs to be broken down into market segments, and a resume must be written for each segment using the words that are understandable to people there."}]}

Maximum 2, ideally 1\n2) If the resume is for the Western market, then the Telegram is unnecessary\n3) This is good, but it's better for the recruiter to see the position in the first lines\n4) Phrases like \"Demonstrated commitments to writing efficient, readable, maintainable, and reusable code with supporting documentation\" are better not to write, use specific examples below where/what you did instead. The line below this is also unnecessary\n5) Descriptions of companies are not needed, it's better to spend that space on your achievements in the company\n6) I don’t know what this is and why to highlight it (but maybe I’m not in the loop)\n7) Words like \"Successfully\" should probably not be used, it should be clear from the description how/what/why you did it\n😍 This means that it's logical to focus on achievements as a lead first, and only then what you did with your own hands\n9) \"Responsible for the quality and performance of services\" - do not write responsibilities, focus on achievements\n10) \"The Team could develop more than 5 services at the same time, nevertheless all services were implemented in time, fully and necessary quality.\" - write about yourself, not the team. If this is your merit - say so. Emphasize it, or else it will be at the end where no one reads\n11) , is unnecessary. Unless Deutsch may make sense if you will apply there\nP.S.

Summary:\n- Why ‘product and startup experience’? It usually makes sense to show Startup and Enterprise as two diametrically opposed sets.\n- Domain expertise should be right in the first sentence. Please move ‘fintech, robotics, IoT, web, SAAS, telecom, and IT-outsourcing' to the beginning. According to marketing laws, you should start with benefits.\n- 2-3 key MEASURABLE achievements in the Summary. You need to grab attention with metrics, not adjectives.\n\n2. Experience\n- Each job is described, but WITHOUT scale amplifiers: revenue, number of people, market share, ratings, number of offices, transaction volume.\n- What does 'team productivity by a third' mean? How is productivity specifically measured? You need concrete process metrics before and after. If they weren’t measured, then build a hypothesis and find a way to prove that the hypothesis works during the interview. But you will have to quantify your impact. In addition to metrics, understanding the number of teams and people helps the recruiter understand the scale of your influence.\n- The theme of ‘transparent and efficient workflow’ is NOT elaborated. To reduce assumptions and conjectures, show HOW exactly your work, tools, and processes allowed you to reduce the number of defects (where, by the way?) by 35%. If you implemented monitoring, code analysis, or automated tests by changing the development team’s attitude toward the product, that’s great. But show how the people whose mindset you improved began to act DIFFERENTLY. Before they were hammering nails with a microscope, now they are doing it with a hammer.\n\n- Always start your achievements NOT WITH THE PROCESS, but with THE RESULT. And describe processes answering the question: how exactly was this result obtained?\n- Launched a rhythmic Release Train - there are 100500 ways to do this knowing the theory. But you found the recipe and it worked. IN PRACTICE. And there’s no need to write that you used theory. Show that in practice you made it clear that the framework is behind your effective actions.\n\n- Listing products (arm Pulse and servo-motors rDrive) only makes sense if you are responding to positions in the same business sphere and competitors/colleagues will happily buy your expertise. Better to operate with product metrics without naming the products themselves if they are not widely known. After all, what's important for me as a recruiter is that you reduced time to market with certain changes in certain time frames and helped (directly or indirectly) the products achieve such and such MAU, DAU, ROI, Market Share, Retention, Churn, NPS, CSAT, Store Rank."}]}

You can assemble such projects from guides in an hour or two, just make it look good.

You might have used ChatGPT and seem to have proofread it, but phrases like 'remarkable 35% improvement' are just meme language. What does 'fostering' mean? It doesn't fit the context and is jarring; it is often used.\n\nThe education section also has issues with spacing and indentation.

In this education section, you made a mistake, \"resolving real tasks in Codwers\" - it should be \"Codewars.\"\n3. SkyPro is also a course, not work, so it doesn’t fit the section.\n4. A small mistake in the \"about me\" section, it says \"development, so that I can grow in QA\" - \"чтобы\" is usually written together.\n\nIMHO. The first thing that stands out is that you have 7 years of experience and aim for QA, but in reality, you have no experience in QA; all your experience is as a \"personal assistant to the manager\" in construction.\n\nI would, in your place (start by rejecting the hh template, because it doesn't work in your favor), and then build a narrative in your resume by points:\n1. \"About me\" (thesis on why you decided to change your field of activity)\n2. \"Education\" (what have you done to switch to a new area)\n3. \"Skills\" (preferably shorten the number of your skills to at least 10)\n4. \"Work experience\" (Here you briefly tell that you worked effectively and productively in one company for 5 years and did a lot of useful things)."}]}
